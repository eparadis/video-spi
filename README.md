This is a fork of @dschmenk 's excellent NTSC video generator given here: https://github.com/dschmenk/Arduino/tree/master/VideoSPI

I stripped out the rest of the repo that was unrelated using (this method)[https://help.github.com/en/articles/splitting-a-subfolder-out-into-a-new-repository]

The original implementation simply generated a demo screen. My intent is to add either a TWI or TTL-serial interface to make it into a terminal.
